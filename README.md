## Overview

This project aims to to create a comprehensive Python library for personal tasks (To-Do List). 

## Features

The application will allow users to:

- Add a new task to the list with at least a name and a description.
- Mark a task as completed.
- Remove a task from the list.

## Documentation

The documentation for this project is generated using Sphinx. To build the documentation locally, run in the docs folder:

```bash
make html
```

Then, open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.

## CI/CD

This project is set up with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. 
Any push to the main branch triggers the pipeline, which runs tests, checks code coverage, and deploys the documentation.
